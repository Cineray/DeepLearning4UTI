## Related lists

There is already [PythonInMusic](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic) but it is not up to date and includes too many packages of special interest that are mostly not relevant for scientific applications. [Awesome-Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) is large curated list of python packages. However, the audio section is very small.
